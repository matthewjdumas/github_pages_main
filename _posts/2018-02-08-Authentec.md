This post expands on my work at Authentec

# Authentec, Inc (2007-2011)

## Overview 
   <p>I started at Authentec as an intern in the R&D Lab working directly under Dale Setlak with Durosomine Taylor. In the lab, I collected 
fingerprint samples, analyzed data, and generally tried to make myself useful. The first thing I really accomplished was automating the data analysis procedure. I did this using Perl, and one weekend, ran 8 months of back-logged data through it, getting the department up to date! This lead to me being asked to help out around the other labs, where Matt Schenk taught me how to solder micro-circuitry under a microscope, and reflow boards. From there on out, I did miscellaneous jobs for the other labs while also testing fingerprint sensors and fingerprint sensor security. </p>
   <p>After a while, my driver requests became a bit cumbersome for the software department and I was afforded the ability to make my own
drivers. This lead to more testing and freed up the lab for more advanced testing with other instruments, such as the finger-print model testing using the HP4194a impedance analyzer. In order to do such tests, I used a mixture of Perl and LabView, along with some VBA macros, to automate the lab. </p>
   <p>Over time, my research lab increased in size from 2 computers and some equipment to up to 16 simultaneously running computers/sensors, and
a whole lot of lab equipment. By 2009, the economy struck Authentec, and a decision was made to lay off a lot of the research staff. It hurt, as I was hoping to continue working at Authentec after I graduated, but I instead joined the Master's program and continued my education. Between 2010 and 2011, I was asked to come back as a Senior Intern with 2 interns reporting directly to me to run some large scale biometric tests, and I did. </p>

## Projects
### Large-Scale Biometric Test (LSBT)
   The large-scale biometric test is a procedure that was performed by Authentec at least one time per year. It consisted of paying hundreds
of users to perform 200-300 swipes of several fingers over 7-10 fingerprint sensors. The purpose of the test was to gain massive amounts of data with which to verify the accuracy and usability of fingerprint sensors on the general population. Data analysis included gain control data, ROC (false accept/reject) curves for accuracy, and demographic/dermatologic data collection. 

#### My contributions:   

- Created and Implemented LSBT Procedures and Protocols 
- Automated data analysis procedures 
- Executed 3 LSBTs 

#### Technologies used:  

- LabVIEW v6/v11 
- HP4194a Impedance Analyzer  
- Perl 
- Visual Basic for Applications 
- C 

### Advanced Security Features  
<p>As the organizer of the biometric research lab, my duties included working on prototypes of new biometric sensors and security methodologies.</p> 

#### My Contributions: 

- Devised new methods of utilizing sensor properties 
- Performed research-based testing and new feature investigation 

#### Technologies/Techniques Used: 

- Perl 
- Pspice/OrCAD 
- C 
- Micro-soldering and reflowing

### Lab Automation 
<p>As the organizer of the biometric research lab, my duties included test automation. To this end, I was able to successfully automate the data collection and analysis procedures. These workflows consisted of retrieving users, collecting the data, storing the data, sorting the data, extracting images, running the matcher, generating statistics, and outputting to Excel on the research network drive.</p>

#### My contributions: 
- Organized and Ran research lab 
- Automated testing procedure across, synchronizing the 16 PCs at each workstation.  
- Automated data analysis routines and data extraction 

#### Technologies used:  
- Visual Basic for Applications 
- Perl 
- Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) framework 
- .NET 2.0 

### Tool Creation 
<p>A part of my automation tasks included the creation of necessary tools to support the automation initiative.</p>  

#### My contributions: 
- Created tool to extract data from debug files. 
- Created tool to calculate pixel gain values from automatic-gain-control output.  
- Created tool to chart and store pixel gain charts. 
- Created tool to analyze false reject and acceptance rates and plot ROC curves.  
- Created LabView automation tool to automate the use of the HP4194a Impedance Analyzer for use in longitudinal studies.  
- Created GPIB Driver for use with LabView system. 
- Modified drivers for research purposes â€“ several modifications were incorporated into production driver. 
- Created moulds of fingerprints for physical hack simulations.  

#### Technologies Used: 
- Perl 
- C 
- .NET Framework 1.1 
- LabVIEW v6/v11 
- Dental/Filling Epoxy 
- Ballistic Gel

#### Products Worked on:  
- AES 2501 
- AES 2510 
- AES 1610 
- AES 1710 
- AES 1810 
- AES 1910
