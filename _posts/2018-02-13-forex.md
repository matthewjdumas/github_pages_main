## Description: 

<p> While looking into job openings recently, I noticed a trend toward web-scripting and frameworks like ReactJS. Having not programmed anything substantial in Javascript in a while, I decided to update my knowledge and put together a demo in a framework I had never used before. </p>

<p> This project represents about 9 hours of work updating my knowledge. It utilizes a RESTful service to obtain minute-by-minute data of the GBPUSD Forex symbol from 2000-2017. It pulls this data and charts it utilizing ReactJS. </p>

## Features
- Dynamic Date Ranges
- Candle-Stick charts

## Examples/Output Tests
