Personal Project: Industrial Camera Controller

---
# Project Name: Industrial Camera Control
### Status: Active - backburnered
### [GitHub Link](https://github.com/matthewjdumas/IndustrialCameraControl)

## Description: 

<p> I have an X-Ray Machine that used an analog camera to observe the scanned image on the sensor plate. Recently, to replace the aging averaging box and live image box, I decided it was a wise idea to upgrade the camera. </p> 

<p> The camera I chose to upgrade to is the YW500 Industrial camera. It utilizes a USB connector and the same lense as the old camera. </p> 

<p> The application I made to control it is a C# .NET application that utilizes DirectShow and EMGU CV to capture a direct video stream from the camera.</p>

## Features
- Live Camera Viewing
- Still Image Capture
- Video Capture
- Frame Averaging
- Filtering
- Color Adjustment (color/greyscale)
- Camera Settings Control

### Filters Available: 
- Smooth
- Median
- Bilateral
- Gaussian
- Sobel

### Camera Settings Available: 
- Resolution
- FPS
- Brightness
- Hue
- Saturation
- Contrast 
- Iris Control
- Exposure

## Compatibility

<p> The project uses .NET 4.5 and is compatible with most windows computers. </p>

<p> The USB Camera compatibility is still in question, it appears to be compatible with most USB Cameras that utilize the general camera interface from Windows. </p>

## Examples/Output Tests

[Add 1 image for each filter type, 1 for no filtering, color and greyscale, and a video](www.google.com)
