# Project Name: Tektronix TVS-645 Waveform Analyzer Interface
### Status: inactive
### [GitHub Link](https://github.com/matthewjdumas/TektronixTVS645WaveformAnalyzerVee)

## Description: 

<p> I have a TVS645 Waveform Analyzer that's a VXI card. In order to run it without the original interface (which I do not have), I needed to come up with a solution to handle all of the GPIB commands.</p>

<p>In order to get it running quickly, I utilized Vee Student 9.3, a visual programming language, like LabView, which has very good hardware compatibility.</p>

<p> The front interface is about 75% feature-complete. However, it's usable enough for me to do nearly anything I need to do. As I need other, more advanced features, I add them to the VEE. In the future, I may migrate this to LabView or C#. </p>

## Features
- Waveform capture
- Waveform Math
- Multiple Probe Capture
- GPIB/488.2 Command processing
- USB-to-GPIB Agilent controls

## Examples/Output Tests

[Need to add front end images and block diagram images, video too maybe]
