# Self-Improvement: Gym Routine
### Status: Active 

## Description: 

<p> I'm actively trying to be better than I was yesterday. For that reason I've taken up a gym routine with the end goal of losing weight and building some muscle.</p>

<p> Since Feb 2017, I've been attempting to lose weight, and I systematically experimented with different foods/meal plans to get to the best possible results for me. Those results continue, since March 2017 to be about 2 lbs weight loss per week without any added activity. </p> 

<p> As of Jan 31, 2018, I've been going to the gym on a MWF schedule. </p> 

## Routine

<p> My routine consists of the following: </p>
- Chest Press
- Leg Press 
- Shoulder Press 
- Rowing
- Swimming Laps

## Data

### Weight
<p> This is my record of my weight from late 2016 onward. It's very sporadic until recently because I was experimenting with my diet and not having all that much luck --- which made me not want to look at the scale. </p>

### Leg Press

<p> The following charts show you how I am stepping up my leg press weights, linearly (chart 1), and how I am structuring it (chart 2). In chart 2, every dip starts a new day with warmup sets, followed by the plateau with the actual goal sets for the day. </p>

#### Linear Progression

#### Goal/Structure

### Chest Press 
<p> The following charts show you how I am stepping up my chest press weights, linearly (chart 1), and how I am structuring it (chart 2). In chart 2, every dip starts a new day with warmup sets, followed by the plateau with the actual goal sets for the day. </p>

<p> The reason you see some missing dates is because some days I alternate and do a shoulder press.</p>

### Rowing
<p> To be completely honest, I've got no clue what I'm doing here -- I just know how to row and use it as a warmup. Currently, my goal has been to increase the total meters rowed by 100 every time, except I've now hit my limit, and I'm going to need to do it a bit more to improve. </p>

### Swimming

<p> Much like Rowing, I don't really know how to structure these, so I started off gunning it and doing the best I can. I quickly found out, however, that after doing all of the rest of the exercises, my body gave out quickly with this method. So, I started putting breaks in between each lap. This took too long and didn't improve anything, so now I do two laps of the 25m pool and then a one minute break, followed by 2 more laps until my arms are too sore to continue. I'll keep doing this until things improve or I find a better way. </p>
