# Basic Information
<p> My name is Matthew Dumas, and I am an electrical engineer and genuinely curious person. I love learning new things and constantly try to push the boundaries. It's because of this that I have had as many experiences as I have and have sought to do as much as I can. I value experience and entertainment. </p> 

<p>This page will serve as a central hub and somewhat of a blog. I'll put my work history here, as well as some review materials I use to keep up to date on the latest tech, and keep it up to date, as well as start to build a portfolio of the things I've done. My hope is to keep it both engaging and relevant to those seeking to know more about me, whether it's for professional or personal reasons. </p>
